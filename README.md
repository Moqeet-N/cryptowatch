CryptoWatch: Cryptocurrency prices made simple.

CyptoWatch utilizes the CoinMarketCap API to fetch data on crypto coins.

The application is based on the Spring MVC Architecture and implements
Thymeleaf which is a Java template engine for processing and creating HTML, XML, JavaScript and CSS.

CryptoWatch has a minimalist and clean design so that the user isn't bombarded with excessive amount of data.
